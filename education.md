### **University of Bath - MRes in Accountable, Responsible, and Transparent AI**  
*September 2020 – September 2021*

**Courses:** Machine Learning, Principles of Programming, Advanced Analytical Techniques, Statistics

---

### **Birkbeck College, University of London - MSc Data Science**  
*September 2017 – September 2019*

**Courses:** Data Science in R, Statistics, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, Data Structure & Algorithms

**Project:** Designed an anomaly detection algorithm using a Variational Autoencoder in the Deep Learning Python Framework. Using statistical tools, I modelled the normal distribution of images and calculated the difference between them and potential anomalies and missing data for automatic anomaly detection.

### **Ural Federal University - Specialist Diploma**  
*September 2006 – February 2012*

**Major Subjects:** Electronics, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Statistical Analysis

**Project:** Developed an algorithm to model the propagation of different types of ultrasound waves and their interactions with defects in various media. This algorithm allowed me to create an application for education in the non-destructive testing field. It was developed using Object-Oriented Programming in C++.
