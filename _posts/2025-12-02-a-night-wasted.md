It was the middle of the night, and my machine learning model was finally ready for testing. I decided to run it for just three epochs to ensure that the training loss was decreasing. However, my excitement quickly turned into exhaustion, and I found it impossible to resist the urge to fall asleep. I thought to myself, "I'll review all 15 epochs in the morning."

When morning arrived, I was met with a rude awakening: my WSL terminal had been killed, and, to my dismay, nothing had been saved. I had never experienced a terminal shutdown after six hours of running a process before, and the frustration was palpable.

This is my first blog post, and I want to share a couple of valuable lessons I learned from this experience:

Do Not Work at Night: While the quiet hours may seem like a great time to be productive, fatigue can lead to costly mistakes.
Always Save Logs: Even if you're running sanity check codes, it’s crucial to save your logs to avoid losing valuable data.
